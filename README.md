# BingKeywordAndLocalityScraper_Alpha
My 'biggest' scraper scraped Bing results for multiple keyword phrases + localities, then scraped pages on the domain linked from the landing page as well as the landing page for email addresses and phone numbers by using ReGex to identify then store these results (as a .csv for easy manipulation). This particular script also counted occurrences of keywords identified in yet another file, then gave a 'score' based on Bing PageRank as well as keyword density.
